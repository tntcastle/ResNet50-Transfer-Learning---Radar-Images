# ðŸ“¡Radar Image Classification using Transfer Learning with ResNet50

### Overview:
This project applies transfer learning using a ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pretrained on ImageNet, to classify radar images from a 77 GHz mmWave radar system. By freezing the convolutional base and training a new classification layer, this model demonstrates how pretrained visual features can be adapted for radar-based object recognition.

### Requirements:
```
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python matplotlib numpy pandas
```
