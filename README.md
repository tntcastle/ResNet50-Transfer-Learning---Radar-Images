##ðŸ“¡ Radar Image Classification using Transfer Learning with ResNet50

This project applies transfer learning using a ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pretrained on ImageNet, to classify radar images from a 77 GHz mmWave radar system. By freezing the convolutional base and training a new classification layer, this model demonstrates how pretrained visual features can be adapted for radar-based object recognition.
